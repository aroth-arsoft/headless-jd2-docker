# Running the container

0.  Become root if your user is not part of the docker group:

    ```
    sudo su
    ```
1.  Create a folder on your host for the configuration files (eg. sudo mkdir /config/jd2)
2.  Run the container:

    ```
    docker run -d --name jd2 \
        -e EMAIL=my@mail.com -e PASSWORD=my_secret_password
        -v /config/jd2:/opt/JDownloader/cfg \
        -v /home/user/Downloads:/opt/JDownloader/Downloads \
        plusminus/jdownloader2-headless
    ```

If you don't want to specify your credentials on the command line, remove them from the command above (`-e EMAIL=... -e PASSWORD=...`) 
and add them manually to the file`<config-dir>/org.jdownloader.api.myjdownloader.MyJDownloaderSettings.json` as in

```
{ "email" : "my@mail.com", "password" : "my_secret_password" }
```
    
# Optional environment variables

EMAIL                | The MyJDownloader account e-mail. Is written automatically to config-file, if set.
PASSWORD             | The MyJDownloader account password. Is written automatically to config-file, if set.
UID                  | Specifies the UID the daemon should run as. All created files will be owned by this UID. Defaults to 1000.
GID                  | Specifies the GID for all created files. This only works in combination with the UID. Defaults to 100 for users.
